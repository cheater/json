ABOUT THIS PROGRAM

This is a simple json manipulation program. What you give it json as a stream
on stdin, and it outputs json on stdout. You pass a key traversal path as the
first argument, of the form of key1.key2.key3 and it only returns objects
accessible through such a path. To traverse through lists you do something like
key1.key2.item.key3 - the 'item' part is a special keyword and it is the one
that steps down into the list.
